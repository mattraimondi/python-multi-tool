# python-multi-tool
A multiple-usage script that combines most of my public python tools into an easy to manage, easy to use solution.

###### This "multi-tool" should be used with python3.

## Calculator
A simple calculator written in Python.<br>
Includes a program to convert between fractions and decimals.<br>
Includes a program that finds the fibonacci value to the nth number (without recursion) and a program that prints the fibonacci sequence infinetly until stopped. Additionally, there is a program which checks to see if a number n is a number in the fibonacci sequence using the property of ((5 * (n * n)) +- 4)=perfect_square.<br>
Includes a program which can translate celcius to fahrenheit and vice versa.<br>
Includes a program that can calculate your current GPA, which can be very useful.<br>
Includes a program that can find the Mean, Median, Mode, Range, or Average of a set of numbers.

## colors
A python color module for creating colored text on the command line.<br>
This library can also be run as an interactive script for changing the color of text on command line interfaces in which colored output is uncommon. (Such as old computers or ones with less capable command line interfaces.)

## Volume
Lets you change the volume from within the macOS command line. Works for OS X 10.6.8 and higher.

## git-status
If you're like me, you keep your git repositories all in one folder. But when working on multiple repositories, it can become hard to remember where you left off in each one. By navigating to said folder, invoking this command will list all of your repos in the folder, and their status. **This program does not check for unpushed commits.**

## iTunes-CLI
Lets you control iTunes, to an extent, from within the macOS command line. Works for OS X 10.6.8 and higher.

# Installation
